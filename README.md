# Reagistration_Form
Certainly! I've created a Full-Stack Register and Login app using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, Node.js for the backend, and React for the frontend). Here's an explanation of the steps you've taken:

Database Schema: I've designed a database schema to define the structure of user data, likely including fields such as 'username' and 'password' for user registration and login.

API Routes: I've set up two API routes, one for user registration (/register) and another for user login (/login). These routes handle incoming requests from the frontend.

User Credential Validation: When a user enters their credentials (username and password), your server-side code performs validation. It checks if the provided details match those stored in the database.

Authentication: If the entered credentials successfully match with the data in your MongoDB database, your app authenticates the user.

Auto-Navigation: After successful authentication, My app automatically navigates the user to the home page, providing access to the secured areas of the application.

This flow ensures that only authorized users with valid credentials can access the protected parts of your app, enhancing security and user experience.
